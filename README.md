# 🚗 CO2 Emission Predictor for Cars

This application predicts the CO2 emissions of a car based on its features using a linear regression model. The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive interface for users to input car specifications and obtain predictions.

## 🌟 Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive interface built with Streamlit.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Instantly get CO2 emission predictions as you input car details.
- **Linear Regression Model:** Uses a machine learning model trained on car data to provide accurate predictions.

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Input Car Features:** Enter the necessary car details such as engine size, fuel type, and other relevant specifications into the provided fields.
2. **Get Predictions:** The application will process the input data and display the predicted CO2 emissions for the car.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Streamlit:** The application is built and deployed using Streamlit, which is required to run the app.
- **Machine Learning Model:** The linear regression model used for predictions is trained on a dataset of car features and CO2 emissions.

## 📈 Model Details

- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Training Data:** The model is trained on a dataset containing various car features and their corresponding CO2 emissions.
- **Features Used for Prediction:**
  - Engine size
  - Fuel type
  - Other relevant car specifications

## 🧩 How It Works

1. **Data Input:** Users input car features into the Streamlit app.
2. **Data Processing:** The app processes the input data and feeds it into the linear regression model.
3. **Prediction Output:** The model predicts the CO2 emissions based on the input features and displays the result to the user.
